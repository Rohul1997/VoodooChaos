# VoodooChaos #

VoodooChaos is a tool that I wrote that will allow the user to do many things

### What this tool can do ###

* Open a CIA file and display the title version and then you can edit the title version and save it.

* Open an NCCH.header/bin file, to display the Unique ID and the Title ID. You can then edit these information and save it.

* Open a Exheader.bin file, to display the Unique ID. You can then edit this information and save it.

* Open an icon.icn/bin file to remove age rating or to remove region lock.
